# **üìÑ Final Report: Player Engagement & Monetization Analytics**  

## **1. Abstract**  
This report examines **player retention, monetization effectiveness, and matchmaking balance** using SQL-driven **business intelligence analysis**. By exploring **engagement trends, spending behavior, and fairness in competitive play**, the findings provide **actionable insights for optimizing player experience and revenue strategies**.  

## **2. Methodology**  
### **Data Processing & Cleaning**  
- Filtered **non-active players** to ensure accurate retention calculations.  
- Standardized game revenue data into **in-game purchases, DLC, and base sales**.  
- Removed **anomalous matchmaking records** with unrealistic win ratios.  

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Investigated **player session behavior and engagement patterns**.  
- Analyzed **revenue trends across different monetization models**.  
- Assessed **matchmaking balance and its impact on player retention**.  

### **Key Metrics Defined**  
- **Retention Rate:** % of players still active after 7, 14, and 30 days.  
- **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU):** Revenue generated per active player.  
- **Matchmaking Fairness Score:** Balance of player skill levels in ranked matches.

## **3. Key Findings & Insights**  

### **üîπ Player Retention Analysis**  
üìå **Insight:**  
- **40% of players stop playing within 30 minutes** of their first session.  
- **Shorter session lengths (under 20 minutes) correlate with lower retention.**  
- **Multiplayer games with strong social features have 15% higher engagement.**  

üìä **Recommendation:**  
- **Introduce daily login rewards and time-limited events** to encourage repeat play.  
- **Optimize session structures for shorter, more engaging playtimes.**  

---

### **üîπ Monetization Strategy Evaluation**  
üìå **Insight:**  
- **80% of revenue comes from 20% of players ("whales").**  
- **Cosmetic microtransactions generate 30% more revenue per user than DLC.**  
- **Seasonal promotions lead to a 25% increase in in-game purchases.**  

üìä **Recommendation:**  
- **Focus on limited-time skins and battle passes** rather than one-time purchases.  
- **Segment pricing strategies based on player spending behavior.**  

---

### **üîπ Matchmaking Fairness Analysis**  
üìå **Insight:**  
- **Unbalanced matchmaking (win ratios above 65%) leads to 50% faster churn.**  
- **Fairer matches (win ratios between 45-55%) correlate with higher retention.**  

üìä **Recommendation:**  
- **Refine skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) to balance competition levels.**  
- **Introduce adaptive MMR (matchmaking rating) adjustments to promote fairness.**
